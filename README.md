# 💫  Hello! I’m Ankush Raj 💫
  👋 Hey, I’m Ankush Raj, an Information Technology undergrad who writes code, breaks it, fixes it (usually), and occasionally ends up learning something new in the process.

I’m into competitive programming, web development, and anything that involves logic, caffeine, and a tiny bit of chaos. Skilled in Linux(Ubuntu), C, Python, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, and Git/gitHub. Currently diving into the Machine Learning world with Python — because it's what excites me the most.

I’ve built projects, participated in hackathons, and love turning ideas into real, working applications — preferably without segmentation faults. Also comfortable with problem-solving, data structures & algorithms, and pretending that debugging is a personality trait.
